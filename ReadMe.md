# Password Generator

Welcome to the **PyPassword Generator**! This project generates a secure password based on user-specified parameters.

## Features
- Allows customization of password length.
- Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Randomized password generation ensures strong security.

## How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you'd like in your password.
3. The program will output a secure, randomly generated password.

## Implementation

In this small project, I have used Python to write my code. I have used a module named random which helps to generate a strong password. I have used basic data structures of python such as lists in the implementation.
